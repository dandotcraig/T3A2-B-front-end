# Introduction

This is the write up for Sup Invoice - an invoicing app designed for freelance creatives. It's simple and helps them get the job done and pay their bills.

We've tested this app with two users:
* one: a designer 
* two: a video editor

The app is named 'Sup Invoice' as its a domain name that was short, cheap and a memorable word. People use the word sup to say hello, which is friendly and its short for super.

#### At a minimum use the following technologies: MongoDB, Express, React & Node
---
Front-end technologies. Mainly React, with Tailwind & ShadCN component libraries.
<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/frontEndTech.png" alt="Front-end technologies" width="300px">


Back-end technologies. Mainly MongoDB (with Mongoose), Express and Node (paired with Nodemon) to run everything.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/backEndTech.png" alt="Back-end technologies" width="300px">

The rest can be seen in package.json files.

# R2	

#### Write well designed code that:
1. Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern
2. Demonstrates DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles

    On the front-end my src folder houses all of the assets, compoents, context and lib files. Each file has its own focus and concern, allowing them to be easily applied and reused.

    <img src="src/assets/assignment-images/frontEndModules.png" alt="Back-end technologies" width="300px">

    **Example one**

    * The header has a mode toggle which toggles dark and light mode - this means its only written once, which is super DRY. The theme is built into context, which provides it to the whole site. This allows for extremely swift and worry free developing. This makes updating my shadCN components a breeze.

    **Example two**

    * The loading spinner is used throughout the site for loading components. Its one component which is in one file, but its called upon in many ways.

    **Example three**

    * UserContext supplies the cookies to authorise acess throughout the site.
    <img src="src/assets/assignment-images/fontEndModuleHighlights.png" alt="Back-end technologies" width="300px">

    On the back-end the folders are organised into tests, bruno(API client) controllers, middleware, models and routes. Each file has its own focus and concern, allowing them to be easily applied and reused.

    <img src="src/assets/assignment-images/backEndModules.png" alt="Back-end technologies" width="300px">

    **Example one**

    * Auth Middleware - on developing the backend, the auth checker for cookies, was copy and pasted many times. This lead to it being converted into middleware, meaning it was only written once and could be passed to any route. This made the code very DRY.

        <img src="src/assets/assignment-images/serverfiles.png" alt="Back-end technologies" width="300px">

    **Example two**

    * For testing purposes - the server was modulized. This meant the database could be detached and a mock databse could provide tests the routes. It's also made it incredibly neat. 

    **Example thee**

    * The router files became very clean and try, this allowed making news ones to be extremely swift and easy.

-   mongoose: the package used to make modals to send the code to our mongoDB database

### Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories

---

The flow control of our users is fundamentally how this app works. The app allows our users to flow through the app based on the inputs they supply. Code is executed on their inputs and this achieves the users desired outcome.

**Login/register**

If a user has an account they can login. If a user wants an account they can register ad add their own personal user/business details.

**Invoice - view/download/create/delete**

If user has login or has registered they can create, download, view and delete invoices. This is all accessable by the home screen

**Users - view/create/delete**

If user has login or has registered they can add, view and edit their own details. This is all accessable by the home screen

**Clients - view/create/delete**

If user has login or has registered they can create, add to invoice and delete clients. This is all accessable by the home screen

### Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns

---

Object Oriented (OO) principles have been heavily applied to mongoose schema structures.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/oo5.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

Object Oriented (OO) principles have been heavily applied to all controller routes.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/oo9.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/oo10.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

### Uses appropriate data structures

---

**Functions**

Functions have been used throughout to create resuable code. Here are a couple of examples:

This auth middleware was created and reused thoughout the backend.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/authmiddleware.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

This header function was made once but used on every page on the app.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/header.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

**Ranges**

Ranges have been used throughout to to handle data. Here are a couple of examples:

Reducers and filers were used throughout to find and complete math logic, here are some examples:

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/filter.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/reducer.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

**Classes (useState/useEffect etc)**

Classes have been updated in recent years in react, therefore hooks which are a newer practice have been used throughout. The app is full of useState/useEffect.

useState and useEffect were used throughout the project to complete almost every useable function on the app, here are some examples:

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/state.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/effect.png" alt="oo" width="300px">

#### Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git)
---
**Front-End**

At the time of writing this my front-end has 72 commits, with 6 completed feature branches. This was important for setting up new fetch routes, adding providers/context, refactoring the code to make it dryer and adding in line-items to invoices, which was was an oversight in the original plan.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/serverfrontend.png" alt="front end git" width="400px">

**Back-End**

At the time of writing this my back-end has 69 commits, with 9 completed feature branches. The branches were extremely important for features like middleware, line items and fragmenting it into files. I had it working and on making these major updates I didn't want to be adding these experiments to main.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/servergit.png" alt="server git" width="400px">

Backend:

* Middleware setup branches
* line item experimentation branches (this was important as I wasn't sure if it would work)
* Router controller development.

# R4	

#### **Demonstrate your ability to work in a team**:
* Use a recognised project management methodology
* Use a recognised task delegation methodology
---

We've used a Kanban framework to impliment agile development processes to complete this first working version of Sup Invoice.

Trello was utilized to impliment deligate tasks, plan the project and follow it through.

#### Produce an application with an intuitive user interface
---

This web application has utilized the ShadCN UI library, as well as tailwind. This mean't that the site is high user friendly and sleakly designed. Which is perfect for our itended users - professional freelance designers. We were tasked with developing an invoicing app. Below are five examples of great intuitive user interface design.
        
**Utilizing tabs**

Tabs are great as they don't feel like you're changing page, as the UX doesn't reload. This means you can display a lot of info and make it extremely easy to access. We used tabs on the home page to display the different pages. Overview, which shows all of the invoices, clients which displays all of the clients and settings which is a form to update the registers users details.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/tabsUX.png" alt="tabs" width="500px">

**Modals** 

Modals are another great UX trick, it makes the user feel like they are still on the home page. Making the pages minimal makes it feel less complex. The fact the user can see the app behind it (blurred) means it doesn't feel hard to get back to the main interface. Modals were utilized twice for client creation, invoice creation and invoice viewing.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/ModalUX.png" alt="modal" width="500px">

**Dark and light mode**

With more and more users getting large 4k screens with strong blue light - light mode is becoming less and less. This is due to it putting a lot of strain on the eyes due to its brightness. The ShadCN library made it really easy to impliment this.

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/dropdownUX.png" alt="dropdown" width="500px">

**Dropdowns**

A user could have hundreds of clients. Thats why we've used dropdowns to display the clients. This means it will appear in a scrollable list, easy for the user to find them. 

<img src="src/assets/assignment-images/darklightUX.png" alt="darklightmode" width="500px">

**Register flow**

The registration flow consists of two screens, one the registration section, which takes an email and password. Then once its been completed, the cookies are stored - meaning the user can be logged straight in. A pop up is added which gets the users details and stores them. Once complete it redirects to the home page so users can start making some invoices!
